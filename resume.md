# Work History

![Intermediate Software Engineer at Entelect]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/Resume/EntelectLogo.jpg){: .align-left}
<h2 class="rightAlignedHeader">Entelect</h2>
<h4 class="rightAlignedHeader"> Intermediate Software Engineer (Apr 2016 - Present)</h4>
<p style="clear:both;">
I worked on a major South African bank's iOS app using Objective-C, Swift, and the RxSwift framework.
</p>
I played a role in preparing the app for Swift compatibility and took on other tasks that improved the architecture of our code base as it grew. I also mentored other developers in the adoption of the Swift programming language as well as the usage of more advanced development practices suited for large, complex applications.

I encouraged the growth of the iOS development skills at Entelect by creating an internal iOS learning course for other employees and presenting iOS development workshops for teams based at other clients to help them get started.

![Mobile Software Developer at Seecrypt]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/Resume/SeecryptLogo.png){: .align-left}
<h2 class="rightAlignedHeader">Seecrypt</h2>
<h4 class="rightAlignedHeader">Mobile Software Developer (Dec 2014 - Mar 2016)</h4>
<p style="clear:both;">
Developed secure messaging and calling applications for iOS (Objective-C), Mac (Swift), and Windows Phone (C#).
</p>
I initially joined the Windows Phone team. While at Seecrypt, I learned Objective-C, Swift, and iOS development. This led to me working on the Objective-C iOS app and the Swift Mac OS X app.

I worked to improve our development environment by writing build and deployment scripts as well as setting up Continuous Integration through Atlassian Bamboo.

<h2 class="rightAlignedHeader">K2</h2>
<h4 class="rightAlignedHeader">Software Engineer (Aug 2013 - July 2014)</h4>
<p style="clear:both;">
While I was studying for my degree, I worked at K2 to gain experience. I worked on a Silverlight application in C#. Working on UI and user experience tasks gave me keen attention to detail while I also developed skills in troubleshooting and debugging.
</p>
